        <h5>1. Personal data</h5>

        <p>According to the GDPR, personal data means “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”</p>

        <h5>2. General use of this website</h5>

        <h6>Logfiles</h6>

        <p>We do not collect and store any personal data in the course of your visit to our website. Notwithstanding the above basic facts, however, the web server of our hoster automatically registers accesses to the websites and in particular your IP address. In addition, our hoster creates so-called log files to maintain system security. This information remains anonymous for us. It is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about a person. The log files contain the following information:</p>

        <p>the IP-address<br />
            date of access<br />
            URL<br />
            contents accessed<br />
            transmitted information</p>

        <h6>Contact</h6>
        
        <p>If you contact us at the email address provided on our website, you will at least provide us with your email address, as well as any other information you may disclose in your email. In order for us to process your request, we need to process this data. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>

        <p>We use Google as our email provider. In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by Google Ireland Limited, Ireland. Google Ireland Limited is a subsidiary of Google LLC, United States of America (website: https://www.google.com/intl/de/gmail/about/). Further information & data protection can be found here: https://policies.google.com/?hl=de. The transfer of personal data to third countries takes place depending on the respective Google service and under the application of the various EU standard contractual clauses, if these are offered by Google. More information on this and Google’s responsibility can be found at the following link: https://business.safety.google/gdpr/.

        <h5>3. Purposes and legal basis of data processing</h5>

        <p>The processing of your IP address during the connection setup takes place so that we can provide you with our website. It is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to provide our website.</p>

        <p>Processing in the context of contacting us takes place so that we can process and respond to your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. By contacting us by email, you consent to the data processing.</p>

        <h5>III. Recipients of the data</h5>

        <p>Within our organization, the departments that are responsible for processing the requests have access to your data. In addition, we use external service providers if we cannot or cannot reasonably perform services ourselves. These external service providers are primarily providers of IT services and telecommunications services. We have concluded data processing agreements with all service providers.</p>

        <h5>IV. Storage duration</h5>

        <p>We store your emails and contacts for as long as it is necessary to process your inquiry and then store them for a period of 3 years in case you contact us again with reference to your original question. We archive business and commercial letters for ten years due to the German Tax Code.</p>

        <h5>V. Rights of data subjects</h5>

        <p>The GDPR guarantees you certain rights which you can assert against us - as far as the legal
            prerequisites
            are given.</p>

        <p>Art. 15 GDPR – Right of access by the data subject: You have the right to obtain from us
            confirmation as to
            whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access
            to the
            personal data and the purposes of the processing.</p>

        <p>Art. 16 GDPR – Right to rectification: You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the
            rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning yourself. Taking into account the purposes of
            the
            processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of
            providing a
            supplementary statement.</p>

        <p>Art. 17 GDPR – Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): You have the right to demand that we delete personal data concerning you without delay. Please note here the exception described under IV.
            4.</p>

        <p>Art. 18 GDPR – Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to obtain from us the
            restriction of
            processing.</p>

        <p>Art. 20 GDPR – Right to data portability: You have have the right to receive the personal data
            concerning
            yourself, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
            and have
            the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to
            which the
            personal data have been provided, or to have us transmit the data to another controller as far as it
            is
            technically possible.</p>

        <p>Art. 21 GDPR – Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons related to
            your
            particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is necessary for a
            legitimate
            interest on our part or in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
            exercise
            of official authority.</p>

        <p>If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove
            compelling
            reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms,
            or the
            processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

        <p>If we process your personal data in order to conduct direct advertising, you have the right to
            object to the
            processing at any time. If you object to the processing for purposes of direct marketing, we will no
            longer
            process your personal data for these purposes.</p>

        <p>Art. 77 DSGVO in relation to § 19 Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) – Right to lodge a complaint
            with a
            supervisory authority: You have the right to lodge a complaint at any time with a supervisory
            authority, in
            particular in the Member State where you are residing, at your place of work or at the place where
            the
            infringement is alleged, if you consider that the processing of your personal data is contrary to
            applicable
            law.</p>

        <h5>VI. Existence of automated decision making (including profiling)</h5>

        <p>We do not use automated decision making.</p>

        <h5>VII. Internet specific data processing</h5>

        <p>During the use of our Internet pages, we automatically record and evaluate technical access data.
            For this
            purpose we use the tool “Matomo” (formerly “Piwik”), an open source program for web analytics, which
            evaluates statistical parameters for the use of our website. However, this data cannot be assigned
            to a
            specific person; the individual user remains anonymous. Further information about “Matomo” can be
            found on
            the website <a href="https://matomo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://matomo.org</a>
        </p>

        <p>This data includes, for example<br />

            The IP address shortened by the last two octets,<br />
            Information about the Internet browser and operating system used,<br />
            the domain name of the website from which a visit to our website is made,<br />
            the average time spent on our website, and<br />
            the pages called in our website.</p>

        <p>In addition, by removing the check mark on this site, we can prevent Matomo from counting your visit
            at all.
            In this case, a cookie will be set to indicate to us that you have objected to its use.</p>

        <p>Please note that the respective settings regarding cookies are only effective for your currently
            used device
            and your currently used browser. If you are using a different device or browser, you will usually
            have to
            change the settings again. We also support the “Do not Track” function of your browser. This allows
            you to
            actively tell us via your browser settings whether you wish your activities to be recorded or not.
            If you
            have activated “Do not Track”, your activities will not be recorded.</p>

        <p>The legal basis for the use of Matomo can be found in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our justified
            interest
            consists in the fact that we evaluate the use of our Website for their improvement and optimization.
            The
            data collected in this way is stored for a period of 24 months.

        <h5>VIII. If you have any comments or questions</h5>

        <p>Protection and security of your data are very important to us. Your questions and comments about privacy are welcome, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:datenschutz@okfn.de">datenschutz@okfn.de</a>.</p>
